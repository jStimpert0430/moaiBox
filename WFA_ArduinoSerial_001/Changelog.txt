'SUPERCARD RFID launcher system
'Version 0.1.2 - In Development

'This program is intended to be used in conjunction with an Arduino and RC522 RFID module running custom software in order to launch various shortcuts or webpages using a 1kb RFID card's 4 byte UID as a unique primary key to read and store data in an OleDb structure.
'A simple tutorial program written for Arduino <-> Visual Basic communication authored by Martyn Currey was used as a base for this project and can be found at - "http://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-and-visual-basic-part-1-receiving-data-from-the-arduino/"
