'SUPERCARD RFID launcher system
'Version 0.2.0 - In Development

'This program is intended to be used in conjunction with an Arduino and RC522 RFID module running custom software in order to launch various shortcuts or webpages using a 1kb RFID card's 4 byte UID as a unique primary key to read and store data in an OleDb structure.
'A simple tutorial program written for Arduino <-> Visual Basic communication authored by Martyn Currey was used as a base for this project and can be found at - "http://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-and-visual-basic-part-1-receiving-data-from-the-arduino/"

CHANGELOG
V 0.2.0 
	-Full DB support implemented
	-Device Com port auto detection now works--Currently, only seeks on launch and for some reason the knockoff arduino I use will not work with it; only the genuine UNO version. Will need to add optional ability to manually select com port and connect. Currently, only tested working device is a genuine uno
	-Tweaked UI, Consolodated options, Removed all com port selection options.
	-Added System tray icon and corrosponding actions
	-Added Popup bubbles on scan with additional options to hide them and mute sounds when minimized


V 0.1.2
	-Reworked card storage from an array of card objects to an oleDB stytem. Instead of reading through an array of objects on scan, now a query is sent to the data source to check for a match. --Add new card functionality is broken temporarily
	-Cleaned up and commented code reworked

V 0.1.1 
	-Main program functionality added, Ability to read card data from arduino and act accordingly works as expected
